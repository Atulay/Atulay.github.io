			[09:50, 16/01/2021] Harshit IT AIT: Step 1 : Relaxation
Relaxation is about letting go of tension and stress and bringing the mind and body into a state of calm and peace…


Step 2 : Concentration
Concentration allows me to use my time productively, once I have relaxed: I focus on the thoughts I choose to have…


Step 3 : Contemplation
Contemplation is reflecting deeply on myself, my inner world and my values…


Step 4 : Realisation
Realisation is when my understanding and feelings combine and I experience a more profound, more meaningful reality within…


Step 5 : Meditation
Meditation is focusing on a thought and remembering my eternal identity, and re-awakening a wonderful state of well-being…
[09:52, 16/01/2021] Harshit IT AIT: 10 Yoga Poses You Need to Know
The building blocks of yoga are poses. These are good ones to learn as you build a regular yoga practice.

These 10 poses are a complete yoga workout. Move slowly through each pose, remembering to breathe as you move. Pause after any pose you find challenging, especially if you are short of breath, and start again when your breathing returns to normal. The idea is to hold each pose for a few, slow breaths before moving on to the next one.
Child's Pose
This calming pose is a good default pause position. You can use child’s pose to rest and refocus before continuing to your next pose. It gently stretches your lower back, hips, thighs, knees and ankles and relaxes your spine, shoulders and neck.
Do it: When you want to get a nice gentle stretch through your neck spine and hips.
Skip it: If you have knee injuries or ankle problems. Avoid also if you have high blood pressure or are pregnant.
Modify: You can rest your head on a cushion or block. You can place a rolled towel under your ankles if they are uncomfortable.
Be mindful: Focus on relaxing the muscles of the spine and lower back as you breathe.
